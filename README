The simulation scripts are based on the method proposed in our paper "Personalization and Optimization of Decision Parameters via Heterogenous Causal Effects" (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10550.pdf)

We share example scripts for merging trees and running stochastic optimization algorithms with simulation data under this repository. The source code contains two main files:
(1) MergeTreeSimulation.R - This code helps us combine the different cohorts corresponding to each metric and each treatment into a single cohort definition.
(2) StochasticOpSimulation.R - This code runs the stochastic optimization routine to identify the optimal parameter in each cohort.
We have also used the open source R library called Causal Tree (https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree) to identify the cohorts for each treatment j and metric k. Using these, the entire methodology discussed in this paper can be easily reproduced for any similar problem of interest.
